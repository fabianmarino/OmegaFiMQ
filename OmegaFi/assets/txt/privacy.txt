        <h3 class="pagetitle">OmegaFi's Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
	At OmegaFi your privacy and the security of your data is a top priority. We pride ourselves on our ability to be your chapter's partner for
	financial success. In order to be this partner, we help fraternities and sororities	manage their membership and alumni/ae data, and we collect and process payments 
	and contributions from those members and alumni/ae for Greek organizations. This Privacy and Data Security Policy describes the privacy policies applicable to OmegaFi's business operations and websites.
</p>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>One of OmegaFi's primary services is to collect, maintain and manage individually
	identifiable information about chapters, their undergraduate members and new
	members and their alumni/ae. As a result, we maintain contact information,
	addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, giving and
	payment information and other personally identifiable information about individuals.
	We obtain this information from your chapter, alumni/ae organizations associated
	with your chapter and your Inter/National Headquarters. We also obtain this
	information from transactions you initiate and information you provide to us.</p>
        <p>From time to time, we also compile online transaction and registration information
	for internal analyses and internal marketing purposes.</p>
        <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>OmegaFi never sells or provides any data or personally identifiable information except
	as authorized by our customers or their members.</p>
In order to serve your needs, we may share information with:

        <ul>
            <li>Credit card processors and financial institutions when necessary to
		process payments made by you and to comply with applicable law;</li>
        </li>
	Lawyers and collection agents only when instructed and authorized by
	our customers to fulfill the terms of our agreement with our customers;
	
    </li>
    <li>The U.S. Post Office and printing and mail house specialists in order to
		communicate with you;</li>
    <li>Your Inter/National Headquarters in an effort, to keep you, your chapter
		and its members and alumni/ae informed about the national
		fraternity/sorority.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to enhance and strengthen the alumni relations program for our customers,
	name, address, phone number and email information about their alumni/ae is
	published on the Internet as a component of a customer's website.</p>
<p>When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court
	order or subpoena or when otherwise legally required.</p>
<p>To protect your confidential information, we only work with companies and financial
	institutions that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use
	of the information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell to other
	third parties the information we provide to them.</p>
<h3>Confidentiality and Security Safeguards</h3>
<p>OmegaFi takes physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against
	anticipated and unanticipated hazards to the information that is stored about our
	customers, chapters, chapter members and their alumni/ae. Data is electronically
	backed-up every night. Back- up tapes are stored in secure locations off-site each
	week.</p>
<p>We protect customer data and accounts by asking you for information that only you
	should know when you contact us. We follow these procedures in our financial
	centers, on the phone and via the Internet.</p>
<p>We train our employees to protect customer information. OmegaFi employees who
	have access to confidential information must treat it confidentially and may not
	disclose it to unauthorized parties. Employees who violate OmegaFi's privacy policy are
	subject to a range of disciplinary actions.</p>

<p>A visitor to the OmegaFi website who does not log- in, is not asked to reveal any
	individually identifiable information. We collect some non-personally identifiable
	information about visitors through standard weblogs, including IP address, what
	browser is being used and the domain name from which a visitor entered our site.
	Some data may be traced to an individual, but we do not normally seek to identify
	individuals unless we believe that someone is using our site improperly.</p>

<p>Some existing customers and chapter members come to our website with IDs and
	passwords already assigned. Others who register at our website provide standard
	contact information such as name, mailing and email address, chapter name,
	college/university name and telephone numbers. We may also obtain credit card
	number information from those who pay online.</p>
<p>When you sign in to the OmegaFi system, your ID and password are sent over the
	Internet from your computer to ours using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
	SSL encrypts your personal information before it leaves your computer, ensuring
	that no one else can read it.</p>

	computer. A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer's hard
	drive. We use cookies to simplify your access and to make our website work for you.
	For some services, we offer users the choice of having an ID or password stored in a
	cookie so that you do not have to reenter it when you return to the site. We do not
	store credit card numbers in cookies. No other site can read a cookie, and we cannot
	read a cookie that another website wrote to your computer. Most Internet browsers
	are set to accept cookies. To fully use our website, you must enable your Internet
	browser to accept cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies, some websites may
	not display properly or you may not be able to access certain information.</p>

	requirements, OmegaFi will from time to time review and revise this Privacy Policy.
